nice isn't it?

## ðŸ”§ Installation

Install the things

```bash
sudo xbps-install -Sy bspwm sxhkd zsh kitty neovim mpd mpc ncmpcpp
```

Install the fonts
```bash
# Go to https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest
# and install the latest Meslo.zip
# Unzip the contents to ~/.local/share/fonts/Meslo
```
<!--
Easter egg? I tried making a command for this but as you can see, I can't.

```bash
# As of version 2.1.0, this command... won't work
# because im bad at making commands
# I'll fix it soon:tm:
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts/Meslo
curl -L https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.1.0/Meslo.zip\
     --output - | unzip -\
     -d ~/.local/share/fonts/Meslo
```
-->

Install Oh My ZSH + Powerlevel10k + Plugins
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-$HOME/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/themes/powerlevel10k

git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

Copy the configs and folders
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Supercolbat/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
cp -r config/* ~/.config
cp -r wallpapers ~
```

#### Finishing NeoVIM setup
First install VimPlug to support installing packages.
```sh
sh -c 'curl -fLo "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}"/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'
```

Once that finishes, launch NeoVim and ignore the countless warnings. Execute `:PlugInstall` to install the required packages.

#### Other steps
For **mpd** (music player daemon) to work, you have to put music in your \~/Music directory. You can change where mpd will look by changing `music_directory` in `~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf`.

* The ultimate rice.
* What inspired my new rice 
* The best Linux rice

* This rice looks *really* good. This was my first inspiration for wanting to use [Eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww).
*  I also liked their README, so you'll definitely be seeing similarities between theirs and mine

The amazing people at [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn)
* It's shocking to see how good people can make their desktops look. If I see a rice that I really like, I'll try to implement that into my desktop.

*more coming soon:tm: :P*

# :memo: Notes
* Rather than copying the default configs (i.e. `/usr/share/examples/picom/picom.sample.conf`)and modifying them, I instead opted in to rewriting them in a way that made sense to me. I also abused a [nifty vim feature](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Folding) to make everything much easier to read. Thanks kitty config for enlightening me!
