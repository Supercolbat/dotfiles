Hello! These are the configs I use in my Fedora system. I've been taking [inspiration](#Credits) from other people's setups and dotfiles and ended up producing this mess.

While I may not be the most creative or artistic person, I still enjoy the challenge of customizing my desktop. However, as my first rice, things are going to be a bit rusty.

Any and all contributions are welcome!

[[bspwm] Pretty Nordy & Rusty (First rice)](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/oayp27/bspwm_pretty_nordy_rusty_first_rice/)
* Main inspiration for the theme (most notably the terminal). Change the color theme a bit and boom!
* also for a first rice, ***thats amazing***

[bspwm-dotfiles](https://github.com/AP2008/bspwm-dotfiles)
* I tweaked it's rofi config a tiny bit to make it fit better with my desktop

[polybar-themes](https://github.com/adi1090x/polybar-themes) (colorblocks)
* I like how this theme looked, but there were a few things I didn't like about it. I ended up using this as inspiration and *mostly* (.config/polybar/scripts/rofi/\*.rasi) writing the bar from scratch.

[mf-dots](https://github.com/obliviousofcraps/mf-dots)
* [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/o9fa24/openbox_eww_not_again_its_pastel_once_more/)
* This rice looks *really* good. I'm probably going to be using [Eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww) once I finally get around compiling it
*  I also liked their README so you'll definitely be seeing similarities between their's and mine

The amazing people at [r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn)
* It's shocking to see how good people can make their desktops look. If I see a rice that I really like, I'll try to implement that into my desktop.

*more coming soon :P*

# :memo: Notes

* As of right now, the workspace module in polybar is... less than adequate. I've just been procrastinating on fixing it. I mean, why fix that when you can upload your dotfiles to Github write a whole README document (and a wiki)? The reason for the wiki is to organize information I'm trying to cram in here without cluttering it too much. Is it necessary? No. Is it cool? Probably.

# TODO
- [ ] comment **everything**
- [ ] `INSTALL.sh` script
- [ ] stop procrastinating
